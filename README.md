# Koria.js which is [kairo](https://github.com/3shain/kairo) rearranged.

The code was written in mid 2022 but wasn't made public. I can't even remember a lot of details. Anyway, at present (one year later) I find out this project and, I'm amazed and can't believe it's actually my work lol. I feed the code to ChatGPT and it responses:

> Overall, this code is an advanced and intricate implementation of a virtual DOM and reactive state system, demonstrating a deep understanding of web rendering and state management concepts.

(but I thought it's neither vdom nor reactivity lmao)

Anyway I make this public, for just entertainment ðŸ¤£
